# Connecting your code to Psi4

## Python

Import [Psi4Numpy] and [Numpy] as 

```python
import psi4
import numpy
```

Learn more about the services offered by Psi4 by working through the [Psi4NumPy basics tutorial](https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy/tree/master/Tutorials/01_Psi4NumPy-Basics)

## Julia

Using [PyCall], import the Psi4Numpy

```julia
using PyCall
using LinearAlgebra
using TensorOperations
psi4 = pyimport("psi4")
np = pyimport("numpy")
```

When dictionaries need to passed to Python routines, they have to constructed in Julia syntax

```julia
options = Dict("basis" => "sto-3g", "scf_type" => "pk", "e_convergence" => 1e-8)
psi4.set_options(options)
```

Matrices can be passed straight into the Julia interpreter

```julia 
wfn = psi4.core.Wavefunction.build(mol, psi4.core.get_global_option("basis"))
mints = psi4.core.MintsHelper(wfn.basisset())
S = np.asarray(mints.ao_overlap())
```

just as spectra can be determined

```julia
e, C = eigen(Hermitian(H), Hermitian(S))
ix = sortperm(e, by=real)
e = e[ix]
C = C[:, ix]
```

and tensors can be contracted

```julia
@tensoropt D[p,q] := C_occ[p,i] * C_occ[q, i]
```

## C++

In a directory of your choosing, create a new plugin (in this tutorial called `test`),

```bash
psi4 --plugin-name test --plugin-template scf
```

build the plugin,

```bash
cd test
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/miniconda3 . 
make
```

and run the plugin.

```bash
psi4
```

Study the `plugin.cc` file to learn more about how to adjust these plugins.

# Project

Based on the instructions [Hartree-Fock project](../hartree-fock/README.md), write your own Hartree-Fock program *that uses the integrals* generated by Psi4.
