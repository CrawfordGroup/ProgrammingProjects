In each project, you will find `README.md` with instructions, and output for you to check your implementation against. These projects will also require some input files that will be discussed 
in each project as they become relevant. These input files can be found in the `inputs` directory. 
Within `input` there are directories for several different molecule/basis-set combinations where you will find integrals, molecular geometries and other files to use as input to your programs.
