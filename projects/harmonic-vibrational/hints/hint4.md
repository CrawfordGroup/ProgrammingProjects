The harmonic vibrational frequencies for the H<sub>2</sub>O test case (in cm<sup>-1</sup>) are:
```
   8 2492.7600
   7 2359.6522
   6 1865.8704
   5 1217.6808
   4 1202.8640
   3 1170.1990
   2    0.0210
   1    0.0000
   0    0.0000
```
Note that there are only three zero frequencies in this case when there should be six. This is because the structure used in the computation is not a stationary point on the potential energy surface, and thus the three “rotational frequencies” are non-zero.
