We offer bootcamps for [C++](cpp/README.md), [Julia](julia/README.md) and [Python](python/README.md). Regardless of the programming language you use, when developing code, it is important to follow the [best practices](https://molssi.org/helpie_faq/best-practices-in-software-design/) and give thought to the design of your software. [Object-Oriented Programming & Design patterns](https://education.molssi.org/oop_and_design_patterns/) can help you structure code into reusable and interoperable pieces of code.
