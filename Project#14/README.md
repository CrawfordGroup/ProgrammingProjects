# Project #14: Excited Electronic States: EOM-CCSD

Description of EOM-CCSD

## Step 1: Obtain CCSD T-amplitudes

You require the converged T-amplitudes generated in [Project # 5](../Project%2305). You should also import the one- and two-electron components of the Hamiltonian.

## Step 2: Create matrix elements of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian

## Step 3: Diagonalize the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian

## Bonus step: Left hand eigenvectors and oscillator strengths
