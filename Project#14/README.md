# Project #14: Excited Electronic States: EOM-CCSD

Description of EOM-CCSD
An overview of the equation of motion coupled-cluster method is given in <sup id="r1">[1](#f1)</sup>.

## Step 1: Obtain CCSD T-amplitudes

You require the converged T-amplitudes generated in [Project # 5](../Project%2305). You should also import the one- and two-electron components of the Hamiltonian.

## Step 2: Create matrix elements of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian

The similarity-transformed Hamiltonian may be written as:

in terms of sums over one-body, two-body and higher terms. These terms can then be found via the BCH expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, in terms of converged T-amplitudes and one- and two-electron components of the Hamiltonian.

## Step 3: Diagonalize the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian

## Bonus step: Left hand eigenvectors and oscillator strengths
